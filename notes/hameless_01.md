# Questions to Questions

A research agenda can be organized around four questions, which is called *Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)*.
- What is the causal relationship of interest
- The experiment that could ideally be used to capture causal effect of interest
- Research questions that cannot be answered by any experiment are FUD's: *Fundamentally Unidentified Questions*
- What is your **identification strategy** ( the manner in which a researcher uses observational data to approximate a real experiment, Angrist and Krueger, 1999)
- What is your mode of statistical inference
  - To describe the population to be studied, the sample to be used, and the assumptions made when constructing standard errors.
